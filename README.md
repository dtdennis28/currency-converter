# README

Welcome to Drew Dennis's submission for the Revolut technical challenge.

The purpose of this application is to:

- Demonstrate my overall Android competency
- Show my familiarity with some of the latest Android-dev tools/frameworks/libs
- Show my understanding of common and modern software design patterns including:
    - Repository pattern
    - Separation of concerns, SRP, etc.
    - Good class & function naming
    - The common notion of "clean architecture" as expressed in the Android dev community
- Express my personal software design philosophy in certain details

With these things said, I would like to mention that because the goals are mainly demonstration
of my abilities, I'm sure there are a number of things that I would do differently in a live
scenario (e.g. I am using Room DB to store a super simple JSON map; I would probably do something like
SharedPreferences if there were no performance constraints in consideration).

In conclusion, please consider the app as a whole an extension of my resume, and know that I am not
tied to any particular pattern or tool in my expertise--just always after the "best" way to do things
in service to the product at hand.

Regards,
Drew Dennis
